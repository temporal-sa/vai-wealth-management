# Wealth Management Agent Example using Vercel AI SDK 

Demonstrates how to use [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) with [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) 
It uns the agent loop inside a Temporal Activity as a durable, replayable, long-running conversation. 
It uses tools to hand off to other agents.

Scenarios currently implemented include
* Add Beneficiary - add a new beneficiary to your account
* List Beneficiaries - shows a list of beneficiaries and their relationship to the account owner
* Delete Beneficiary - delete a beneficiary from your account
* Open Investment Account - opens a new investment account using a **Child Workflow**
* List Investments - shows a list of accounts and their current balances
* Close Investment Account - closes an investment account

## Application Architecture

The overall application architecture looks like this:

![](../../images/application-architecture.png)

There is a React UX which is where the customer interacts with the application.
The React UX leverages an API which exposes endpoints to start a workflow, send a prompt,
retrieving the chat history, and ending the chat. The React frontend uses adaptive polling
to retrieve new events from Redis, providing real-time status updates as the Open Account
child workflow progresses through the different steps.

The API in turn, communicates with Temporal to start workflows and send signals. Finally,
the worker contains the two workflows - supervisor and open account - which contain the
agents and business logic that drive the agentic application.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Temporal CLI](https://github.com/temporalio/cli) the Temporal CLI
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (used for chat history; optionally for the claim-check payload codec)
- A [Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

## Install dependencies

From the project root:

```shell
npm install
```

## Set up your Gemini API key

Create `setllmkey.sh` at the project root with your key:

```shell
export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="<your-key-here>"
```

## Set up Redis 

Redis is used for storing conversation history and providing real-time status updates. If you don't have an existing Redis server, you can run one locally after installing it.

In a new terminal / shell run the following command:
```shell
redis-server
```

By default, the application expects to find Redis running locally. You can override the location of Redis by setting the environment variables:

```shell
export REDIS_HOST=localhost
export REDIS_PORT=6379
```

## Set up Claim Check (optional)

An optional configuration is to substitute the data sent to Temporal (e.g. function/method parameters and return values)
with an ID. This is known as the [Claim Check Pattern](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/StoreInLibrary.html).
The original data is stored in Redis. This uses a
[Custom Payload Codec](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/python/converters-and-encryption#custom-payload-codec)
that intercepts data going to Temporal Cloud, replaces it with a GUID. When the data is retrieved, it looks up the GUID
replaces it with the data stored in Redis.

```shell
cp setclaimcheck.example setclaimcheck.sh
chmod +x setclaimcheck.sh
```

Now edit the setclaimcheck.sh file and fill in the location of Redis
It should look something like this:
```shell
export USE_CLAIM_CHECK=true
export REDIS_HOST=localhost
export REDIS_PORT=6379
```

Save the file and be sure that you have Redis running. For example:

```shell
redis-server
```

Note that the application assumes you only have one Redis server that is used by the application for storing the
conversation history and is also used if Claim Check has been enabled.

Be aware that using a claim check pattern introduces performance costs by doing remote calls to Redis for every payload.
Also, make sure your Redis implementation is rock solid as any downtime will directly affect your workflows.

## Run Codec Server for Claim Check (optional)
If you have decided to set up the Claim Check above, you will
most likely want to also run a Codec Server to be able to see the actual sent to
the workflow and activities.

Be sure you have updated the setclaimcheck.sh as mentioned above.

To run the Codec Server:
```shell
./startcodecserver.sh
```

And of course, make sure that your Redis Server is up and running.

Once it's up and running, the default endpoint is http://127.0.0.1:8081.

Open up your browser and navigate to the Temporal UI. Locally that is usually localhost:8233.
For Temporal Cloud that will be https://cloud.temporal.io

In the upper right, there is an icon that looks like glasses. Click on that and you
can configure your codec server.

Change the drop down to "Use my browser setting and ignore Cluster-level setting".

Use the endpoint of your codec server (default is http://127.0.0.1:8081). Be sure there are no
extra spaces at the end of the URL or it will not work. You can turn off the two options - Pass the
user access token and Include cross-origin credentials. Click on apply and you have configured
the codec server.

As you run through different scenarios, you'll be able to see the decoded values in the browser.

If you remove the codec server settings, you won't be able to see anything other than a BASE64 Encoded ID.

## Running the Demo locally

### Start the Worker 

Start Temporal locally
```shell
temporal server start-dev
```

### Connect locally

```shell
cd src/temporal_supervisor
./startlocalworker.sh
```

### Start the API

```shell
cd src/api
./startlocalapi.sh
```

### Start the UX

```shell
cd src/frontend
npm start
```

A new browser window opens where you can interact with the application.

If you are opening a new investment account, in another terminal
### Send the Compliance Reviewed Signal
```shell
cd src/temporal_supervisor
./localsendcomplianceappoval.sh <Child Workflow ID>
```

## Running the demo in Temporal Cloud

Copy the setcloudenv.example, located in the src/temporal_supervisor folder to the project root and name it setcloudenv.sh.

```shell
cp  src/temporal_supervisor/setcloudenv.example setcloudenv.sh
```

Edit setcloudenv.sh to match your Temporal Cloud account:

```shell
export TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=<namespace>.<accountID>.tmprl.cloud:7233
export TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE=<namespace>.<accountID>
export TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH="/path/to/cert.pem"
export TEMPORAL_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH="/path/to/key.key"
```

### Start the Worker

```shell
cd src/temporal_supervisor
./startcloudworker.sh
```

### Start the API

```shell
cd src/api
./startcloudapi.sh
```

### Start the UX

```shell
cd src/frontend
npm start
```

If you are opening a new investment account, in another terminal

### Send the Compliance Reviewed Signal

```shell
cd src/temporal_supervisor
./cloudsendcomplianceapproval.sh <Child Workflow ID>
```

Here are a few screenshots of the UX while opening a new account.

You can also add and delete beneficiaries.
